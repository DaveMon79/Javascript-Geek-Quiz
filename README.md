# UFC---Knockout-Quiz

I was tasked with making a quiz without any starter code. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I had to create a quiz which incorporated the following features.

*	Functional start, question, go back and submit buttons
*   A timer which deducts time for an incorrect answer
*	Questions which appear one after another once an answer is given
*	Store high scores in local storage
*	linking HTML pages


# Actions taken

I started by writing the html and css which I’m comfortable with. Once i started on Javascript, I broke down the project in to sections and wrote pseudo code to follow in an attempt to simplify the project.


# Code Style

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

# Difficulties

I found this project extremely challenging as my knowledge of Javascript is still limited. Despite watching endless hours of YouTube videos and reading a javascript which I’ve purchased, I wasn't able to able to get all the functions working.


# Success

While I wasn't able to complete the project in full, I was able to get the following functions working.

*	Responsive start button which activated the quiz
*	Quiz questions and answers pull from JavaScript with responsive answer buttons
*	Working countdown timer which deducted time for an incorrect timer, and cleared at the end of the quiz
*	I was able to hide and show sections of HTML through Javascript
*	Scoring system worked and saved to local storage
*	Alerts to let user know if they got the answer right or wrong
