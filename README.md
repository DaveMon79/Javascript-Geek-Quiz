# UFC---Knockout-Quiz

I was tasked with making a quiz without any starter code. Using HTML, CSS and Javascrip i had to create a quiz which incorperated the following features.

* Functional start, question, go back and submit buttons
* A timer which deducts time for an incorrect answer
* Questions which appear one after another once an answer is given
* Store high scores in local storage
* linking HTML pages

# Actions taken

I started by writing the the html and css which i'm comfortable with. Once i started on Javascript, i broke down the project in to sections and wrote psuedo code to follow in an attempt to simplify the project.


# Code Style

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

# Difficulties

I found this project extrememly challenging as my knowledge of Javascript is still limited. Dispite watching endless hours of youtube videos and reading a javascript which i've purchased, i wasn't able to able to get all the functions working. 


# Success

While i wasn't able to complete the project in full, i was able to get the following functions working. 

* Responsive start button which activated the quiz
* Quiz questions and answers pull from Javascript with responsivve answer buttons
* Woring countdown timer which deducted time for an incorrect timer, and cleared at thee end of the quiz
* I was able to hide and show sections of HTML thorugh Javascript
* Scoring system worked and saved to local storage
* Alerts to let user know if they got the answer right or wrong
